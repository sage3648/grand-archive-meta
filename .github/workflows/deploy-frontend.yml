# Vercel automatically deploys the frontend when you push to GitHub.
#
# To set up Vercel auto-deployment:
# 1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
# 2. Import your GitHub repository
# 3. Select the frontend directory as the root
# 4. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
#    - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL (your backend API URL)
#    - Any other frontend-specific variables
# 5. Vercel will automatically deploy on:
#    - Every push to main (production)
#    - Every pull request (preview deployments)
#
# Vercel deployment features:
# - Automatic deployments on push
# - Preview deployments for pull requests
# - Automatic HTTPS
# - CDN distribution
# - Edge functions
# - Analytics and monitoring
#
# If you need a custom workflow for testing before Vercel deploys,
# uncomment and customize the workflow below:

# on:
#   push:
#     branches:
#       - main
#     paths:
#       - 'frontend/**'
#   pull_request:
#     branches:
#       - main
#     paths:
#       - 'frontend/**'
